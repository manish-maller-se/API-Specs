		"description": "# Overview\nThis platform delivers a consolidated, contextualized, and reliable connection to portfolio-wide building systems for data-driven decision making and customized digital services via its developer-friendly APIs. \n\n# Documentation\n\n## Building Data Platform Introduction\n\nBuilding Data Platform is an independent data layer, providing centralized API access to application ready BMS and IoT data. \n\nThe data platform interfaces with existing BMS solutions to extract real-time operational data. This integration will encompass HVAC, lighting, security, room control, metering, and other systems. The data platform accommodates an array of IoT devices, including sensors and actuators. These devices generate data related to occupancy, temperature, air quality, and more. By integrating IoT data, the layer enhances real-time monitoring and analysis capabilities, enabling proactive decision-making for building management. The data platform is built in a scalable and system-agnostic manner where additional device types can be flexibly configured within the data model.\n\nThe data platform offers robust IT interoperability, supporting industry-standard cloud communication protocols such as MQTT, HTTPS, Web Socket, Web Hook RESTful APIs. The data platform is supplemented with native integrations to Schneider Electric's edge servers via MQTT. The SpaceLogic AS-P and Enterprise Server supports standard protocols including BACnet, LonWorks, Modbus, Web Services, and MQTT.\n\nBuilding Data Platform contextualizes incoming source data with Brick semantic tags for devices and locations. Devices can represent physical equipment and sensors or represent virtualized systems such as a room scene control. By leveraging Brick schema, the data platform makes all the information collected on the sites available in a standard format, ensuring application-ready consumption and interoperability between disparate equipment and systems.\n\nBuilding Data Platform's Access & Control API is a REST API which provide consumers with pro-grammatic access to building data. The API enables reading of data values and actuation of commands when applicable systems contain writable properties. The Building Access & Control API also provides access to historical data values. This API facilitates integration with third-party applications, custom dashboards, and analytics platforms. By offering standardized endpoints, the layer promotes data-driven decision-making across a variety of use cases.\n\nBuilding Data Platform's Data Streaming API is implemented on Azure Event Hub providing access to real-time data streams. The data layer will ingest, process, and distribute real-time data, enabling immediate insights and proactive responses to critical events. The streaming interface is also equipped with change notifications. Consumers can register for change notifications on the event hub stream which will result in notifications at change of value (CoV) events.\n\n## Authentication\n\nOnce you have your portal access you can obtain an API Token using the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials workflow with your consumer credential information. For more information on getting access to the portal and consumer credentials please refer to our document _Portal User Guide – Partner Viewer User_\n\nYour token endpoint is found at the following address where the {tenantId} is unique to the tenant you use in the Building Data Platform: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token`\n\nBuilding Data Platform is backed by Microsoft Entra ID. Token generation follows standard application development practices. \nSee [Microsoft identity platform and the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-client-creds-grant-flow#get-a-token) for more information on the OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials workflow or [Get a Token](#get-a-token) for a detail of obtaining a token for use with our APIs.\n\n### Get a token\n\nAfter you've acquired the necessary authorization for your application, proceed with acquiring access tokens for our APIs. To get a token by using the client credentials grant, send a POST request to the `/token` Microsoft identity platform. \n\n### Access token request with a shared secret\n```\nPOST /{tenantId}/oauth2/v2.0/token HTTP/1.1           //Line breaks for clarity\nHost: login.microsoftonline.com:443\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n\nclient_id=b5a043d1-69da-4b81-9b76-dbd6a03b1461\n&scope=api%3A%2F%2F4d72d298-0401-4918-aa0c-6c768cbc42e3%2F.default\n&client_secret=sampleCredentials\n&grant_type=client_credentials\n```\n\n| Parameter | Condition | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| `tenant` | Required | The directory tenant the application plans to operate against, in GUID format. |\n| `client_id` | Required | The application ID that's assigned to your consumer credential. You can find this information in the Building Data Platform portal where you registered your consumer credential. |\n| `scope` | Required | The scope that's assigned to your consumer credential. You can find this information in the Building Data Platform portal where you registered your consumer credential. |\n| `client_secret` | Required | The client secret that was generated for your app in the Building Data Platform portal. The client secret must be URL-encoded before being sent. |\n| `grant_type` | Required | Must be set to `client_credentials`. |\n\n### Token Validity\n\nThe JWT (JSON Web Token) obtained using the process above has limited validity. After expiry you may create a new token by repeating the create token flow. The JWT itself, as well as the response of the create token request provides information about the expiry time. In the JWT there is a `exp`\\-claim and in the response there is a `expires_in` property.\n\nThe `exp` (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing. It's important to note that a resource may reject the token before this time as well - if for example a change in authentication is required or a token revocation has been detected.\n\n## Building Data Platform API Endpoint Basics\n\nFor production applications, the base endpoint is:  \n`https://ecostruxure-building-platform-api.se.app`   \n\nFor UAT applications during development the base endpoint is:  \n`https://ecostruxure-building-platform-api-uat.se.app`  \n\nThe UAT instance of our Building Data Platform contains a [Swagger](https://ecostruxure-building-platform-api-uat.se.app/swagger) page for API developers. Swagger (OpenAPI) is a language-agnostic specification for describing REST APIs. It allows both computers and humans to understand the capabilities of a REST API without direct access to the source code. \n\nDevelopers may use Swagger to make sample requests and download an Open API specification JSON document. \n\n[Building Data Platform OpenAPI Specification](https://ecostruxure-building-platform-api-uat.se.app/swagger/v1/swagger.json)\n\n[OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/)\n\n\n### Date and Time\nAll date time values used in `POST`, `PATCH`, and `GET` filters are in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n\nDate time is in ISO 8601 format. This standard is used to represent date and time in a format that is easily understood across different countries and cultures. The T separates the date and time components, and the Z indicates that the time is in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)\n\n\n### Filtering\n\nMany API Routes support filtering. Filters are provided as URL query parameters and in all API routes filters are optional.\n\n#### Example\n\nFilter all spaces in a building with `OntologyType` of value `Office`.\n\n```\nGET /api/Buildings/3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f/Spaces?ontologyType=Office\n```\n\nFilter all MeasurementValues in a floor to values which were `updatedAfter` February 24th, 2024 at 10:00:00 UTC.\n\n```\nGET /api/Floors/ef69d3a6-91ce-455b-8380-06e5c3238f51/MeasurementValues?updatedAfter=2024-02-24T10%3A00%3A00.000Z\n```\n\n### Changing the number of items per page\n\nPage size is controlled by using the `take` parameter.\n\n#### Example\n\nSet the maximum number of records to receive in the response to `10`.\n\n```\nGET /api/Buildings/3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f/Spaces?ontologytype=Office&take=10\n```\n\n### Using `link` headers\n\nWhen a response is paginated, the response headers will include a `link` header. If the endpoint does not support pagination, or if all results fit on a single page, the `link` header will be omitted.\n\nThe `link` header contains URLs that you can use to fetch additional pages of results. For example, the previous, next, first, and last page of results. \n```\nlink: <https://environment.name/api/Buildings/3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f/Spaces?ontologytype=Office&take=10>; rel=\"First\" \n```\n### API Versions\nOver time, newer versions of our API can be introduced. The latest version of our API will become the default version after it has been in production for 1 minor version update unless explicitly stated in the request header. Use the `X-Api-Version` header to set the version of API you require.\n\nVersion 1 API\n``` 'X-Api-Version: 1' ```\n\nVersion 2 API\n``` 'X-Api-Version: 2' ```\n\n## Common HTTP Status Codes\n\n### [Successful responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)\n\n[`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/200)\n\nThe request succeeded. The result meaning of \"success\" depends on the HTTP method:\n\n-   `GET`: The resource has been fetched and transmitted in the message body.\n-   `HEAD`: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body.\n-   `PUT` or `POST`: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body.\n-   `TRACE`: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.\n\n[`201 Created`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/201)\n\nThe request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after `POST` requests, or some `PUT` requests.\n\n[`202 Accepted`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/202)\n\nThe request has been received but not yet acted upon. It is noncommittal, since there is no way in HTTP to later send an asynchronous response indicating the outcome of the request. It is intended for cases where another process or server handles the request, or for batch processing.\n\n\n### [Client error responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses)\n\n[`400 Bad Request`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/400)\n\nThe server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).\n\n[`401 Unauthorized`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/401)\n\nAlthough the HTTP standard specifies \"unauthorized\", semantically this response means \"unauthenticated\". That is, the client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.\n\n[`403 Forbidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403)\n\nThe client does not have access rights to the content; that is, it is unauthorized, so the server is refusing to give the requested resource. Unlike `401 Unauthorized`, the client's identity is known to the server.\n\n[`404 Not Found`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404)\n\nThe server cannot find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized. In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist. Servers may also send this response instead of `403 Forbidden` to hide the existence of a resource from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its frequent occurrence on the web.\n\n### [Server error responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses)\n\n[`500 Internal Server Error`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/500)\n\nThe server has encountered a situation it does not know how to handle.\n\n## Standards & Formats \n\nBuilding Data Platform standardizes on [Brick Schema](https://brickschema.org/) for data contextualization.\n\nBrick is an ontology-based metadata schema that captures the entities and relationships necessary for effective representations of buildings and their subsystems. Brick describes buildings in a machine readable format to enable programmatic exploration of different operational, structural and functional facets of a building.\n\nA Brick model is a digital representation of a building that adheres to the Brick schema. Entities in a Brick model are classified according to the classes defined by Brick, and are connected using the relationships defined by Brick.\n\nBrick can be extended to meet requirements not modeled within the standard. Extending Brick may include adding new classes, new relationships, new entity properties, new documentation or ontology rules.\n\n## Policies\n\n### Compatibility Policy\n\nOur APIs will evolve over time by the introduction of new properties and endpoints. Prepare your parsers for new properties, so that they are allowed in order not to break the client.\n\nAs long as possible we strive not to change the behavior of existing properties and breaking changes are introduced under new versions of our APIs. However, the behavior of an API may change without warning if the existing behavior is incorrect or constitutes a security vulnerability.\n\nSee [API Versions](#api-versions)\n\n### Deprecation\n\nWe reserve the right to deprecate APIs in full or in part. Care will be taken to ensure this is only done after introducing improved ways to achieve the same outcomes or transition paths are clear to newer versions of our APIs.\n\nTo allow application developers time to update their implementations, when deprecating we will provide 3 months' notice to all registered consumers.\n\n\n## Building Data Platform's Access & Control API\n\n## Tenants (API V1 Only)\n```\nGET /api/Tenants\nGET /api/Tenants/{tenantId}\n```\nReturns tenant information available to your consumer or to the tenant id provided.  \n>Tenants are the top level of the Building Data Platform system hierarchy. Tenants represent a logical collection of sites that typically represent an organization registered in the Building Data Platform.\n\nExample Response:\n``` json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"SE BDP Demo\",\n    \"siteCount\": 1,\n    \"id\": \"e3aa120e-824d-4e43-91a9-5924690934d0\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n## Organizations (API V2 Only)\n```\nGET /api/Organizations\nGET /api/Organizations/{organizationId}\n```\nReturns organization information available to your consumer or to the organization id provided.  \n>Organizations are the top level of the Building Data Platform system hierarchy. Organizations represent a logical collection of sites that typically represent an organization registered in the Building Data Platform.\n\n## Spatial Routes\n\nBuilding Data Platform adopts a strict relationship for spatial mapping of buildings. The requirements are that there must be at least one building in a `Site`, at least one floor in a `Building`, and at least one `Space` in a `Floor`. The relationship is:\n\n![](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNp1UDtvgzAQ_ivWTalEIl4B20OlJjTq0olOhQwnbMAS4MgYtWnCfy9NQ9shvenue0n3naDQQgKHstFvRY3Gkpck78h1HrJUWbkny-X9-Ql7gpY0EntLdCfPZLPYDKoRqqvufi2bbAb_s20Xu0Zr88eznZVnkmTpAQtJvP1N-vFK-7fp3ZUO9uBAK02LSkzPnb7EOdhatjIHPq1Cljg0Noe8GycpDlanx64Abs0gHTB6qGrgJTb9dA0HgVYmCiuD7Q8qhbLaPH_Xd2nRgQN2r1q3c8x0Aj_BO_DAjVeM-XG0DsOAUspiB47APbqKQ8YClwV-GKzjcHTg4xLgrlgYuT71Yp9FjHrUGz8BLoZ-rw?type=png)\n\n>:bulb:To retrieve spatial data from our APIs, your consumer subscription must include one or more space with a device. In the event that your subscription does not net any  devices you will not be able to retrieve spaces such as `Site`, `Building`, and `Floor` from the spatial APIs. Not all spaces require devices, you will be able to obtain spatial data from a building with no devices providing your subscription includes one or more device from another building.\n\n###

Measurement values inherits the Space property of the parent `Device`.\n\nFor example, an occupancy count sensor may be given the context of `Building` if it measure all occupants in a building at the entry. It likewise could also have been given the context of `Floor` if it measure the occupants on a floor of the building. But it would always need to have a `Space` assigned such as _Ground Floor Entry Hall_\n\nA temperature sensor may be given the context of `Space` when it measures a room.\n\nThe `Measures` value will be the relationship to the spatial object such as the `Building`, `Floor`, or `Space`\n\nAn example could be:\n\n ![](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNqNkcFugzAMhl8lyqmT2kPZjcOkAYNepkmj2gU4WMGFaCRBabKpavruywhIbXeZT_b3247tnClTLdKYHgb1zXrQhuyzWhJvz1XJDTZks3kiySqxfGi57B6CmFQLCAnpKh-U0os6sazYVhl-cYaFVnZsgpYGrSpHYEi2N_RlptENzWf6ONN8ou5dKUH2KEbUYKxGR4rqFeHoXYHSfMBg_fTernu5aUzyxpgdQbITSZWVxpHd39LrVdyy7T8rQ60_QFh2uUNzx6M7HnAxR9EU7eiaCtQCeOu_6fyr1dT0_rmaxt5tQX_WtJYXnwfWqPIkGY2Ntrim_uxdT-MDDEcf2bEFgxmHToOY6eUHUMidfA?type=png) \n\n### DeviceGroups\n```\nGET /api/Buildings/{buildingId}/DeviceGroups\nGET /api/DeviceGroups/{deviceGroupId}\n```\n\nReturns device group information for the building or device group id provided.\n\nExample Response:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"siteId\": \"005056b3-144c-43e7-931a-1a9c38ac1b04\",\n    \"buildingId\": \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\",\n    \"source\": 32,\n    \"referenceId\": \"GraphUAT-A5F7D88496D647455ED508DBB8644C5C-94FCE49A70604B3A93EC8411A74558B3\",\n    \"commissionedStatus\": 1,\n    \"commissionedOn\": \"2024-02-15T11:25:40.7259502+00:00\",\n    \"decommissionedOn\": null,\n    \"deviceCount\": 96,\n    \"metadata\": [\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ServerName\",\n        \"value\": \"AS-P\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ServerGuid\",\n        \"value\": \"15e0caa3-9a29-48be-82cf-456d5552057f\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ServerType\",\n        \"value\": \"server.AS-P\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"name\": \"ServerVersion\",\n        \"value\": \"6.0.1.93\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"id\": \"53c2304a-5f8e-474b-ab21-96b83af19774\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nEcoStruxure Building Operation Servers also support a Direct Method to get or set values, see the section [On Demand API](#on-demand-api) for more information.\n\n### Devices\n```\nGET /api/Buildings/{buildingId}/Devices\nGET /api/Floors/{floorId}/Devices\nGET /api/Spaces/{spaceId}/Devices\nGET /api/Devices/{deviceId}\n```\n\nDevices are the physical or logical representation of a piece of equipment, such as an IoT Sensor or a Light. Devices can be queried by their relationship to Buildings, Floors, and Spaces. Calling the Devices route explicitly with a device id returns the device information for the single device. When a device is returned, information pertaining to all its associated measurements are also returned.\n\nV2 API changes the property *type* to *ontologyType* and now aligns to Brick Classes\n\nExample Response:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"type\": \"Indoor_Air_Quality_Sensor_Equipment\",\n    \"siteId\": \"005056b3-144c-43e7-931a-1a9c38ac1b04\",\n    \"buildingId\": \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\",\n    \"floorId\": \"dad4e267-5924-4b2d-847c-4ebd4c0c4ff2\",\n    \"spaceId\": \"4e4c1013-edc8-4059-ab19-e47515eafc1f\",\n    \"deviceGroupId\": \"6ca78a6d-8329-4ee4-bef4-dbf7307b0ed9\",\n    \"source\": 32,\n    \"referenceId\": \"00-000 IAQ Sensor\",\n    \"commissionedStatus\": 1,\n    \"commissionedOn\": \"2023-09-28T23:00:00+00:00\",\n    \"decommissionedOn\": null,\n    \"name\": \"00-000 IAQ Sensor -

Not all objects are writeable and a measurement value property of `isWriteable` declares if the value may be written from a remote application.\n\nV2 API changes the property *type* to *ontologyType* and now aligns to Brick Classes\n\nExample Get Response:\n`GET /api/MeasurementValues/35f97940-ceee-43d7-ab1c-0a1b24cfa33c`\n```json\nV1 API\n{\n  \"type\": \"Temperature_Setpoint\",\n  \"siteId\": \"005056b3-144c-43e7-931a-1a9c38ac1b04\",\n  \"buildingId\": \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\",\n  \"floorId\": \"c5217595-14e8-4a66-ab26-3ee88e8123fd\",\n  \"spaceId\": \"277cceb9-8caf-4e15-9cd9-1e4c90dc26b3\",\n  \"deviceId\": \"85cf978e-0dc0-49f4-8468-4e897ea169c6\",\n  \"deviceGroupId\": \"6ca78a6d-8329-4ee4-bef4-dbf7307b0ed9\",\n  \"referenceId\": \"nspg:lNPqAN1s9U+WyWOwrNFUSQ.2LPKodosAk2x50YjrDJGAg//Value\",\n  \"context\": 0,\n  \"measuredId\": \"277cceb9-8caf-4e15-9cd9-1e4c90dc26b3\",\n  \"name\": \"TemperatureSetpoint\",\n  \"unit\": \"°C\",\n  \"value\": 23.5,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-23T18:51:31.514094+00:00\",\n  \"metadata\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"EcoStruxure Building OperationPropertyPath\",\n      \"value\": \"/Server 1/BDP Demo/Building Overview/Level-02/02-005 Conference Room/02-Space Logic Sensor/04-Variables BDP/01-Writeable Variables/Space Temperature Setpoint/Value\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isWriteable\": true,\n  \"source\": 32,\n  \"commissionedStatus\": 1,\n  \"commissionedOn\": \"2023-09-19T11:52:41+00:00\",\n  \"decommissionedOn\": null,\n  \"id\": \"35f97940-ceee-43d7-ab1c-0a1b24cfa33c\"\n}\n\nV2 API\n{\n  \"ontologyType\": \"Air_Temperature_Setpoint\",\n  \"siteId\": \"005056b3-144c-43e7-931a-1a9c38ac1b04\",\n  \"buildingId\": \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\",\n  \"floorId\": \"c5217595-14e8-4a66-ab26-3ee88e8123fd\",\n  \"spaceId\": \"277cceb9-8caf-4e15-9cd9-1e4c90dc26b3\",\n  \"deviceId\": \"85cf978e-0dc0-49f4-8468-4e897ea169c6\",\n  \"deviceGroupId\": \"6ca78a6d-8329-4ee4-bef4-dbf7307b0ed9\",\n  \"referenceId\": \"nspg:lNPqAN1s9U+WyWOwrNFUSQ.2LPKodosAk2x50YjrDJGAg//Value\",\n  \"context\": 0,\n  \"measuredId\": \"277cceb9-8caf-4e15-9cd9-1e4c90dc26b3\",\n  \"name\": \"AirTemperatureSetpoint\",\n  \"unit\": \"°C\",\n  \"value\": 22,\n  \"timestamp\": \"2024-06-03T17:18:03.833362+00:00\",\n  \"metadata\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"EboPropertyPath\",\n      \"value\": \"/Server 1/BDP Demo/Building Overview/Level-02/02-005 Conference Room/02-Space Logic Sensor/04-Variables BDP/01-Writeable Variables/Space Temperature Setpoint/Value\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isWriteable\": true,\n  \"source\": 32,\n  \"commissionedStatus\": 1,\n  \"commissionedOn\": \"2023-09-19T11:52:41+00:00\",\n  \"decommissionedOn\": null,\n  \"id\": \"35f97940-ceee-43d7-ab1c-0a1b24cfa33c\"\n}\n```\n\nAs an example, to modify the value of the Temperature Setpoint to 16.3, a `PATCH` can be made to the `MeasurementValue` by id with the following body.\n\nExample Write Request:\n`PATCH /api/MeasurementValues/35f97940-ceee-43d7-ab1c-0a1b24cfa33c`\n```json\n[\n  { \n    \"op\": \"replace\",\n    \"path\": \"/value\",\n    \"value\": 16.3\n  }\n]\n```\n\nA successful write request will get an empty 200 response.\n\n\n### DataSets\n`DataSets` are designed to give client applications the ability to create logical groups of data which can be tracked and requested through the `MeasurementValue` API route.\n\nApplication developers can create and manage `DataSets` using the `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` Verbs available below.\n\n`DataSets` contain an array of `Building`, `Floor`, and `Space` identifiers. A `DataSet` may contain a mix of types. For example, a data set can contain all measurement values from:\n1. Building A\n1. Floor 1 of Building B\n1. Floor 2 of Building B \n1. All meeting rooms from Building C   \n   \n\nAlternatively a DataSet could contain:\n1. All Occupancy Sensors from Floor 2 Building B\n\nIt is possible to manage multiple datasets for your client and you can use a dataset to manage measurement values which meet application specific criteria after discovering the measurement values of interest.\n\nData can then be retrieved from the `DataSet` whilst it remains active. Take note of the `expiresOn` property during the lifecycle of the `DataSet`.\n\n```\nGET     /api/DataSets\nPOST    /api/DataSets\nGET     /api/DataSets/{dataSetId}\nPATCH   /api/DataSets/{dataSetId}\nDELETE  /api/DataSets/{dataSetId}\n\n```\n\nExample Respose to `GET /api/DataSets`\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"name\": \"Demo Building DataSet 1\",\n    \"expiresOn\": \"2024-02-23T20:37:14.59+00:00\",\n    \"members\": {\n      \"buildings\": [\n        \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\"\n      ],\n      \"floors\": [],\n      \"spaces\": []\n    },\n    \"id\": \"596079e2-22a2-4999-9ba2-08dc32e00a41\"\n  }\n    {\n    \"name\": \"Demo Building DataSet 2\",\n    \"expiresOn\": \"2024-02-24T00:00:00.00+00:00\",\n    \"members\": {\n      \"buildings\": [],\n      \"floors\": [],\n      \"spaces\": [\n        \"0e056104-3638-4841-aa8f-b532492ea5a8\",\n        \"10321efa-94d2-4115-85a0-5f245401bca6\",\n        \"8ebb67d0-f7d9-454e-b348-3d0ca40b6a10\",        \n      ]\n    },\n    \"id\": \"596079e2-22a2-4999-9ba2-08dc32e00a41\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\nExample Request to `POST /api/DataSets`\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Demo Building DataSet 1\",\n  \"expiresOn\": \"2024-02-23T19:37:14.590Z\",\n  \"members\": {\n    \"buildings\": [\n      \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\"    \n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSuccessful requests to POST returns a 200 response with the following body.\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Demo Building DataSet 1\",\n  \"expiresOn\": \"2024-02-23T19:37:14.59+00:00\",\n  \"members\": {\n    \"buildings\": [\n      \"3e171897-48c7-4079-883d-3f6964afba9f\"\n    ],\n    \"floors\": null,\n    \"spaces\": null\n  },\n  \"id\": \"b80c5333-0d4d-4546-c0d5-08dc32e02c39\"\n}\n```\n\n## On Demand API\n\n### Device Groups\n>:exclamation:Requires your consumer to be enabled for type `On Demand API`\n```\nPOST /api/DeviceGroups/{deviceGroupId}/GetOnDemand\nPOST /api/DeviceGroups/{deviceGroupId}/SetOnDemand\n```\nThe `POST` Body contains either the full EcoStruxure Building Operation Server path to the object, or an encoded string representing the EcoStruxure Building Operation GUID values of the server and object, the property name should always be provided at the end of the path and is typically `/Value`.\n\nFor example using nspg server guid:\n``` json\n    \"id\": \"nspg:QfYqlHpaROeShMIcVsuMew.zCN7mG+8ScGjx6H9DZlMNA//Value\"\n```\nor using EcoStruxure Building Operation server path:\n``` json\n    \"path\":\"/Server 1/Demo/Analog Value/Value\"\n```\n\nWhen reading or writing values to EcoStruxure Building Operation, all activity is logged in the Building Management System under the context of the authorizing user which is part of the setup of the Building Data Platform MQTT Interface. Only values which can be read or written by that authorizing user are accessible to the On Demand API, but the values do not need to be configured as part of the MQTT Data Group telemetry feed.\n \n#### GetOnDemand\nOne or more id's may be passed in the array to retrieve values directly from source.\n``` json\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": \"nspg:QfYqlHpaROeShMIcVsuMew.zCN7mG+8ScGjx6H9DZlMNA//Value\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": \"nspg:QfYqlHpaROeShMIcVsuMew.OwjdjYZmTMmVSOxsw/mQ+A//Value\"\n  }\n]\n```\nOne or more paths may be passed in the array to retrieve values directly from source.\n``` json\n[\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/Server 1/Demo/Analog Value/Value\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"path\": \"/Server 1/Demo/Digital Value/Value\"\n  }\n]\n```\nExample Response:\n``` json\n[\n  {\n    \"identity\": {\n      \"id\": \"nspg:SeA3mCmkSYifIOF36cvz/Q.alavXinSQw+cRvRmnUiUwA//Value\"\n    },\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"value\": \"21\",\n    \"timeStamp\": \"2024-02-23T04:48:12+00:00\",\n    \"metadata\": {\n      \"Status\": \"Normal\",\n      \"ValueType\": \"Double\",\n      \"Unit\": \"NoUnit\",\n      \"ResponseCode\": \"Success\"\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n#### SetOnDemand\nOne or more id or path and value pairs may be passed in the array to set the value directly to the source system where the object is writeable.\n``` json\n[\n    {\n      \"identity\": {\n        \"id\": \"nspg:QfYqlHpaROeShMIcVsuMew.zCN7mG+8ScGjx6H9DZlMNA//Value\"\n      },\n      \"value\": \"10\"\n    }\n]\n```\n```json\n[\n    {\n      \"identity\": {\n        \"path\": \"/Server 1/Demo/Analog Value/Value\"\n      },\n      \"value\": \"20\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\nSuccessful response will be an empty `200` response body.\n\n## Historical API\n### HistoricalValues\n> :exclamation:Requires your consumer to be enabled for type `Historical API`\n```\nGET /api/Buildings/{buildingId}/HistoricalValues\nGET /api/Floors/{floorId}/HistoricalValues\nGET /api/Spaces/{spaceId}/HistoricalValues\nGET /api/DeviceGroups/{deviceGroupId}/HistoricalValues\nGET /api/Devices/{deviceId}/HistoricalValues\nGET /api/MeasurementValue/{measurementValueId}/HistoricalValues\n\n```\n\n`HistoricalValues` API Routes allow application developers to make historical data requests from the Building Data Platform time series data store. Building Data Platform offers different site data retention policies. Historical Data requests will only be honored for requests made for data within the sites data retention policy.\n\nExample Response:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"measurementValueId\": \"fbde9301-1f5e-4b9e-85a2-0a13489fa1e3\",\n    \"value\": \"19\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-22T13:10:32.156622+00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"measurementValueId\": \"fbde9301-1f5e-4b9e-85a2-0a13489fa1e3\",\n    \"value\": \"19.5\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-22T14:10:32.157308+00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"measurementValueId\": \"fbde9301-1f5e-4b9e-85a2-0a13489fa1e3\",\n    \"value\": \"19\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-22T15:10:32.160758+00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"measurementValueId\": \"fbde9301-1f5e-4b9e-85a2-0a13489fa1e3\",\n    \"value\": \"18\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-22T16:10:32.233397+00:00\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"measurementValueId\": \"fbde9301-1f5e-4b9e-85a2-0a13489fa1e3\",\n    \"value\": \"21\",\n    \"timestamp\": \"2024-02-22T17:10:32.161203+00:00\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n>:bulb:Overall performance of Historical API calls is generally quicker if you make multiple requests with a shorter time range, such as one day, rather than to retrieve multiple pages for a long-time range, such as one month. The difference is more pronounced for buildings with larger data sets than for those with small data sets.\n\n\n## Data Streaming API\n\n### EventHubs\n>:exclamation:Requires your consumer to be enabled for type `Streaming API`\n```\nGET     /api/EventHubs\nGET     /api/EventHubs/{eventHubId}\nPATCH   /api/EventHubs/{eventHubId}\n```\n\nEventHubs are configured for a consumer where the Streaming API is selected. EventHubs allow developers to consume streaming data as it is processed in real-time by the Building Data Platform.\n\nInformation on configured EventHubs can be obtained from the Data API routes above.\n___\n\n_Usage of APIs is subject to an agreement between the customer and Schneider Electric._\n\nContact Support:\n Name: Schneider Electric Building Data Platform Support\n Email: cloudapp.support@se.com",
