In order to retrieve a new access_token, call the Token endpoint with grant_type as *refresh_token* and pass the refresh_token issued before.\n  \n  Each access_token is valid for 1 hour and has to be provided to every API call as HTTP Request Header `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}` \n\n\n![Authorization Code Flow](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecostruxure-openapi/public-images/main/energy-sustainability-scoring/authorization_flow.png \"Authorization Code Flow diagram\")\n\n## Sandbox Testing\n\n**What is Sandbox Test Data?**\n\nSandbox test data refers to simulated data that can be used for testing or validating an API without manipulating real production data. It provides a safe environment for developers to experiment with the API, test different scenarios and identify errors before deploying it to the production server.\n\n**Why is Sandbox Test Data Important?**\n\nWorking with live production data can be risky, especially during development and testing phases where unexpected changes can occur. Sandbox test data allows developers to create an isolated environment where they can test new features, fix bugs, and improve overall performance without causing any harm to the production data. This helps save time, money and minimizes the risk of introducing new issues into the production system.\n\nGet access token for sandbox testing using sandbox authorize endpoint mentioned below  \n\n> Sandbox authorize endpoint: https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/sandbox-authorize\n\n## Operations and Resource Model\n\n![Operations and Resource Model diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecostruxure-openapi/public-images/main/energy-sustainability-scoring/open-esx-energy-scoring.diagram.png \"Operations and Resource Model diagram\")\n\n## Support\n\nContact our Exchange support team at exchange.support@se.com and include,\n\n    - Endpoint URL\n    - Request/Response of the URL\n    - Any additional information like Screenshots, Postman collections\n\nGet help from the community [here](https://community.se.com/t5/Green-Building-Scoring-and/bd-p/green-building-certification).\n\n---",
