		"description": "# Overview\n\nEcoStruxure™ Energy and Sustainability Scoring Internal API allows Schneider Electric applications to configure buildings that needs benchmarking by calculating performance scores using the building energy and sustainability data.\n\n## API overview and usage\n\nThis API enables the following operations:\n\n**Sites metadata**\n- Retrieve all sites belonging to which the connected user has access, along site metadata needed for performance scores calculation (e.g. gross area, building occupants, operating hours, etc)\n\n**Sites registration**\n- Allows the Schneider Electric application to register a site for calculating performance scores by sharing site timeseries details automatically.\n\n**Performance scores**\n* Read current and historical scores for a given site\n* Supported Types: Daily, Monthly, Average, Local Average \n* Supported Categories: Electricity, Fuel, Water, Waste, Human Experience\n\n# Documentation\n\n## How to sign up\n    \nThis is an internal API product. Please contact ecostruxure.openness@se.com for access.\n\n## Authentication guide\n\nThe API is meant for SE internal applications, application can choose one of following method to generate token and invoke API on behalf of a customer.\n\n### SE application integrated with cIAM\n\nIf the SE application is integrated with cIAM, application will already have access to cIAM id_token. SE application can exchange this id_token for API access token using `Exchange cIAM id_token` operation. CURL example below. This way the token generated is associated with the cIAM identity, the consent provided by the user will be stored against the cIAM identity.\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/token' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n--data-urlencode 'id_token=base64encodedidtokenfromciam' \\\n--data-urlencode 'grant_type=id_token' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_id=abcdeff' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_secret=******'\n```\n\n### SE application not integrated with cIAM\n\nIf the SE application is not integrated with cIAM, application can generate an access token using `Impersonate an user` operation. CURL example below. This way the token generated is associated with the cIAM identity, the consent provided by the user will be stored against the cIAM identity.\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST 'https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth-impersonate/token' \\\n-H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n--data-urlencode 'email=john.doe@yopmail.com' \\\n--data-urlencode 'grant_type=user_token' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_id=abcdeff' \\\n--data-urlencode 'client_secret=******'\n```\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Operations and Resource Model\n\n![Operations and Resource Model diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ecostruxure-openapi/public-images/main/energy-sustainability-scoring/open-esx-energy-scoring.png \"Operations and Resource Model diagram\")\n\n## Support\n\nContact our Exchange support team at exchange.support@se.com and include,\n\n    - Endpoint URL\n    - Request/Response of the URL\n    - Any additional information like Screenshots, Postman collections\n\nGet help from the community [here](https://community.se.com/t5/Green-Building-Scoring-and/bd-p/green-building-certification)\n\n---",
