		"description": "# Overview\n\nSchneider Electric provides EcoStruxure™ Energy Performance scoring Data API for getting energy performance in the site to understand your energy consumption.\n\n## API overview and usage\n\nThis API enables the following features:\n\n* Real-time tracking of energy performance of a site\n* Historical energy performance analysis\n* Integration with existing sustainability tools\n* Access to energy performance score from different providers\n\n## How it works\n\n### Listing Sites\n\nThe API provides an endpoint for listing all the sites that you have access to. This is useful for initially discovering what site IDs are available for further data extraction.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/energy-performance-score/v1/sites\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\n### Fetching Performance Data for a Specific Site\n\nOnce you have a list of site IDs, you can use another API endpoint to fetch the performance data for a specific site\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/energy-performance-score/v1/sites/YOUR_SITE_ID/performance-scores\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can programmatically list all the sites available to you and then, using a specific site ID, fetch the corresponding next level of data like meters, measurements, active-energy etc.\n\n\n# Documentation\n    \n## How to sign up\n    \n**Step 1:** [Register or login](https://exchange.se.com) with an Exchange account.\n\n**Step 2:** Subscribe to the [API product in our Shop](https://exchange.se.com).\n\n**Step 3:** After subscription, API credentials and usage details for the API are available in developer portal.\n\n## Authentication guide\n\nThis API supports the following authentication mechanism:\n\n### OAuth2 Authorization Code Flow\n\nThis authorization schema is intended for ISV applications that have obtained authorization from a Schneider Electric customer. Follow the steps below to initiate the authorization process, obtain an access token, and refresh the token as needed.\n\n**Step 1: Initiate Authorization and Consent Flow**\n\nFirstly, your application should initiate the Authorization and Consent flow by calling the Authorize Endpoint.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/authorize\" \\\n     -d \"client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" \\\n     -d \"response_type=code\" \\\n     -d \"redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\" \\\n     -d \"scope=required_scope1 required_scope2\" \\\n     -d \"state=YOUR_STATE_STRING\"\n```\n\nUpon successful authorization and user consent, you'll be redirected to the `redirect_uri` you provided, and an authorization code will be appended as a query parameter.\n\n**Step 2: Exchange Authorization Code for Token**\n\nOnce you have received the authorization code, you need to exchange it for an access token by calling the Token Endpoint.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/token\" \\\n     -d \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\\n     -d \"code=RECEIVED_AUTHORIZATION_CODE\" \\\n     -d \"redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI\" \\\n     -d \"client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" \\\n     -d \"client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\"\n```\n\nThis will return an `access_token` and a `refresh_token`.\n\n**Step 3: Refresh the Token**\n\nYour `access_token` will be valid for 1 hour. To get a new one without requiring the user to log in again, use the `refresh_token`.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/v1/oauth/token\" \\\n     -d \"grant_type=refresh_token\" \\\n     -d \"refresh_token=YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN\" \\\n     -d \"client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID\" \\\n     -d \"client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\"\n```\n\nBy following these steps, your ISV application can securely interact with Schneider Electric's API services, with the proper authorizations in place.\n\n### Personal Access Token Flow\n\nThis authorization mechanism is intended for end users who are using the API to access their own data in Schneider Electric's ecosystem. Upon purchasing the API, end users can generate a Personal Access Token directly from the Exchange DevPortal.\n\n**How to Generate a Personal Access Token**\n\n1. Log in to the [Exchange DevPortal](https://exchange.se.com).\n2. Navigate to the API product you have subscribed to.\n3. Locate the \"Generate Personal Access Token\" section and follow the on-screen instructions to create your token.\n\n**How to Use the Personal Access Token**\n\nOnce you have generated your Personal Access Token, you can use it as a Bearer Token to authorize your API calls.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET \"https://api.exchange.se.com/ecostruxure/energy-performance-score/v1/sites\" \\\n     -H \"Authorization: Bearer YOUR_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\"\n```\n\nYour Personal Access Token serves as a credential that grants you access to your own data. Ensure that you keep it secure and never share it publicly.\n\n## Support\n\nContact our Exchange support team at exchange.support@se.com and include,\n\n    - Endpoint URL\n    - Request/Response of the URL\n    - Any additional information like Screenshots, Postman collections\n\nGet help from the community [here](https://community.se.com/t5/Energy-Efficiency-and/bd-p/green-building-certification).\n\n\nContact Support:\n Name: API support",
