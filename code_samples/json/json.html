		"description": "\n# Overview\n\nThis API provides access to the electrical grid failure risk warning signals issued by RTE through the EcoWatt mechanism in France. The API has been designed for Schneider Electric internal use and to be able to handle multiple sources of information about the grid conditions that would be relevant to EcoStruxure products in the future.\n\nThe ambition is to be able to provide other grid condition data such as CO2 levels or prices, for as many countries as possible.\n\nTo request the addition of more data sources, contact ecostruxure.openness@se.com.\n\n## API overview and usage\n\nThe API currently supports following.\n\n### Multiple country support\nThe API currently provides grid information for France only. As other data sources get added, we will update the list of supported countries in the dedicated resource: `List supported countries`.\n\n### Multiple forecast providers\nTThe API sources data from EcoWatt. As other data provider get added, we will update the list of supported forecast providers in the dedicated resource: `List supported forecast providers`.\n\n### Different forecasting data\nThe API currently provide data about Grid unbalance risk. As other grid conditions are sourced, we will update the list of supported forecasts in the dedicated resource: `Get Forecast`.\n\n\n# Documentation\n    \n## How to sign up\n    \nThis is an internal API product. Please contact ecostruxure.openness@se.com for access.\n\n## Authentication guide\n\nGird forecasting API provides access to public data hence minimal API key authentication is enforced for the API.\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Code Samples\n\nYou can leverage the code samples provided to integrate the API faster in your application.\n\n* ### <a href=\"https://github.com/ecostruxure-openapi/grid-condition-forecasts-api/tree/main/code_samples/postman_collections\" target=\"_blank\">Postman Collection</a>\n\n\n## Support\n\nContact the SE Exchange support team at exchange.support@se.com and include:\n* Endpoint URL\n* Request/Response\n* Any additional information like Screenshots, Postman collections.\n\n\nContact Support:\n Name: Schneider Electric\n Email: exchange.support@se.com",
