		"description": "# Overview\nEcoStruxure™ Asset Advisor data API allows customers to collect and manage status and health of critical assets in electrical distribution networks.\n\nThis API is available as an optional module of EcoCare for Electrical Distribution. For more information please contact us.\n\n## API overview and usage\nThis API enables the following operations:\n\n**Sites and Assets**\n- Browse and discover sites and assets information.\n- Provide sites and assets specific details (e.g. risk level, health indexes).\n\n**Tickets**\n- Access all tickets generated on all assets from all sites.\n- Access all tickets for a given asset of a site.\n- Provide tickets specific details.\n\n**Webhook Subscriptions**\n- Get notifications on ticket changes.\n- Get notifications on asset health index changes.\n- Get notifications on site risk level changes.\n\n## How it works\nThis API works for any Schneider Electric customer who has an identity in the Schneider Electric cIAM system. Nevertheless, customers must subscribe to this API to use it. The current version of the API is including the operations that are described below.\n\n### Explore Sites\nThis set of APIs allows customers to browse all their Sites registered in Asset Advisor.\n\nIt is possible to access basic information of each site, such as ID, name, address, and location, which allows customers to do a mapping of Asset Advisor sites with their own representation and IDs, and also to locate all Sites in a map.\n\nWith the detailed view of a Site, customers are able to access information such as the Service Level subscribed for the Site, Site Health level and the Health Matrix of the Site (including criticality and health index).\n\n### Explore Assets\nThis set of APIs allows customers to browse all Assets for a specific Site registered in Asset Advisor.\n\nIt is possible to have two different views of the Assets within a given Site. The first one is the List View, providing a standard list of assets for a given Site, including asset information such as ID, name, description, type, and criticality. The second view is a Tree View, providing the entire hierarchy of assets for a given Site, allowing customers to build a complete Site topology.\n\nFinally, it is possible to get specific details of each Asset, including the health index, fire prevention index, maintenance information, and many other technical details. \n\n### Access Tickets\nThis set of APIs allows customers to retrieve all tickets in Asset Advisor, including both alarms and recommendations. These tickets are either triggered by the Asset Advisor Analytics modules or manually created by Schneider Electric experts. This information allows customers to create their own customized dashboards with all tickets from their electrical distribution networks.\n\nIt is possible to query tickets using some filters such as:\n\n- Date range (ticket creation date)\n\n- Status (e.g. only \"Opened\" tickets)\n\n- Priority (e.g. Only \"High\" priority tickets)\n\nBesides the above filters, it's also possible to limit the number of tickets in the response or retrieving specific range of tickets by setting the offset & limit filters for pagination capability. These queries return a list of \"light\" tickets, providing basic information such as title, description, asset, site, priority, status and creation date.\n\nIt is also possible to retrieve all tickets for a particular Asset of a Site, with similar filtering and pagination capabilities. This allows customers to create a consolidated view of tickets for a particular Asset of a Site.\n\nFinally, it is possible to get specific details of each Ticket, including information such as priority, status, creation date, history of changes, comments and attachments. This allows customers to create a detailed view of each ticket.\n\n### Webhook Subscriptions\nThis set of APIs allows customers to manage event notifications through *webhook subscriptions*. The customer will be able to register/update/remove a subscription, list available subscriptions, and get details of a given subscription. The webhook subscriptions will provide notifications to customers based on some topics.\n\nCurrently, the topics concerning are:\n\n**Ticket**\n- Notified on any ticket modification. \n- Currenlty, notification are sent when the ticket *\"priority\"* has changed or when an *\"activity\"* has been performed on the ticket (e.g. close the ticket).\n- Set *\"All\"* for both *priority* and *activity* filters during subscription to get notified for all ticket events.\n\n**Asset Health**\n- Notified when the asset health changed.\n- *\"healthIndexThreshold\"* is a mandatory filter to create a subscription and get notified only when the asset health value has changed with a value equals or above this threshold.\n- *\"sitesScope\"* is an optional filter to restrict the notification to a particular list of Site IDs.\n\n**Site Risk Level**\n- Notified when the site global risk level changed.\n- *\"riskLevelThreshold\"* is a mandatory filter to create a subscription and get notified only when the site risk level value has changed with a value equals or above this threshold.\n- *\"sitesScope\"* is an optional filter to restrict the notification to a particular list of Site IDs.\n\nFor all topics explained above, customers must provide a callback URL to receive the event notifications. When any event matching a webhook subscription is available, the callback URL will be notified with a call from Asset Advisor.\n\nThe callback URL must meet the following requirements for the event notification to properly arrive:\n- Must be reachable over the internet.\n- Its domain name must be resolvable by DNS service over the internet.\n- Its domain name must have a valid certificate.\n\nFor all topics, the message format sent to the callback URL is the following:\n```json\n{\n    \"topic\": \"{topicName}\", // enum {Ticket, AssetHealth, SiteRiskLevel}\n    \"id\": \"{topic id string}\", // \"guid\" of the Ticket, Asset, or Site\n    \"siteId\": \"string\", // \"guid\" of the Site\n    \"assetId\": \"string\", // \"guid\" of the Asset\n    \"timestamp\" : \"string\", // ISO 8601 format, \"2023-02-08T17:09:44+00:00\"        \n    \"events\": [\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\"key\": \"{event property name}\", \n\t\t\t\"oldValue\": \"{Previous value if possible}\",\n\t\t\t\"newValue\": \"{New Value}\"\n\t\t}\n      ]    \n}\n```\n\n# Documentation\n\n## How to sign up\nThe current version of the API does not allow subscriptions on demand.\n\nSelected customers will be signed up manually, based on specific agreements with Schneider Electric, and will be able to access the API with the following information:\n\n**Step 1:** Receive the Exchange URL access for the API product.\n\n**Step 2:** [Register or login](https://exchange.se.com) with an Exchange account.\n\n**Step 3:** Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) in the developer portal (API credentials and usage details are also available).\n\n## Code Sample\n\nYou can leverage the following code samples to integrate the API faster in your application:\n\n<div id=\"gitsample\"></div>\n\n## Support\n\nContact the SE Exchange support team at exchange.support@se.com and include:\n\n    - Endpoint URL\n    - Request/Response of the URL\n    - Any additional information like Screenshots, Postman collections, etc.\n\n---\nVisit <a href=\"https://community.se.com/t5/EcoStruxure-Asset-Advisor-Forum/bd-p/ecostruxure-asset-advisor-forum\" target=\"_blank\">the community</a> to discover related discussions and questions.\n\n\nContact Support:\n Name: Schneider Electric\n Email: exchange.support@se.com",
